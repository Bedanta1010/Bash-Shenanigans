## 🛠️ Bash Mini Projects

### 1. ✅ **System Information Script**

This project collects system stats such as memory usage, disk usage, CPU load, and GPU information, and logs them into a timestamped `.log` file.

> ⚠️ **Important:**  
> Run this script from a terminal **opened inside the `System Information/` folder**, where the script resides.  
> This ensures that logs are created correctly in the `system_logs/` directory inside that folder.

#### 🎯 Objectives:
- Practice real-world Bash scripting
- Learn how to gather system metrics using tools like `free`, `df`, `uptime`, and `nvidia-smi`
- Use ANSI colors (`tput`) for formatted terminal output
- Save logs in a structured folder
- Build your own reusable monitoring tool

#### ✅ Outcomes:
- 💡 Developed a working Bash utility script
- 🎨 Gained experience using formatting and colors
- 📂 Learned to create logs and manage output data
- 🔁 Reinforced core Bash commands and control flow
